# TP Feedback for Team 16
                                        
**TP Grade**: A-
                                        
## Immersion Design
articulated design that targets specific user experiences that relates well to immersion concepts
                                        
## Immersion Implementation
implementation is clearly related to immersion design and works well
                                        
## Evaluation Method
appropriate data collection method was performed but lacks quantity and/or quality
                                        
## Evaluation Analysis
data was only somewhat analysed briefly to form conclusions
                                        
## Documentation
a comprehensive README (clear/detailed instructions and architecture) and a well-made video demo (well-scripted articulations with good footages)
                                        
## Software Engineering
demonstrated decent software development processes across some aspects of creating/delegating/monitoring work packets across members collaboratively
                                        
## Other feedback
Good demonstration of flow concepts in the design. Good articulation of how implementation relates to design as well.

Decent methods employed to collect data based on concepts learned in class, but did not mention why you only chose certain dimensions of cybersickness, etc. The analysis also lacks detail and clarity, e.g., the observations discussed were not clearly/explicitly linked to evidence from the data, and many sub-dimensions of the experiences were not discussed.

Documentation - readme file was just ok as architecture is lacking. Video is well scripted and edited, and nicely shows teamwork.
Software engineering - link to Trello board provided in an obscure file that was not linked in the README, which showed some high level tasks. Some minimal task distribution seen in the small number of branches.
